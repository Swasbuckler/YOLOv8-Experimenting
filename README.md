I have used a Kaggle Dataset from Alin Cijov named "Self-Driving Cars", and experimented using YOLOv8 functions on it.

I had tried to produce a custom YOLOv8 based model with the labels given in the dataset, however I could not make it work due to constantly exceeding the free available RAM in Google Colab. 
It may have been because of my inefficient parameters of the custom model or improper preprocessing of the data.

In the end I had used a pre-trained model named YOLOv8s which enabled good object detection in the images. 

I had learnt a lot of using YOLOv8 and although I was successful in detecting objects, I was not able to create a custom model. I hope to explore more of this area and improve my understandings in the future.
